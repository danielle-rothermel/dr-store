## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-24

Initial release.

### Added

- Content addressing: `compute_content_hash`, `is_content_hash`, and
  `CONTENT_HASH_LENGTH` — the full 64-character lowercase SHA-256 Content
  Hash of a complete canonical record, computed through `dr-serialize`'s
  canonical JSON with no second canonicalization dialect.
- Typed content-addressed handle `ObjectReference`, validated at
  construction so an empty schema or malformed content hash can never
  enter the store.
- `ObjectStore` owning three operations and nothing else: immutable put
  (`PutStatus`), verified get, and one generic atomic key-to-reference
  binding (`BindStatus`) — every write append-only, replay idempotent,
  and differing content a typed conflict that never overwrites.
- Two interchangeable backends behind the neutral `Backend` protocol:
  `MemoryBackend` for tests and single-process use, and `SqliteBackend`
  durable under concurrent cross-process use, with `PutOutcome` and
  `BindOutcome` as the backend-level compare-and-set results.
- Typed error taxonomy rooted at `StoreError`: `ReferenceValidationError`,
  `ObjectConflictError`, `ObjectNotFoundError`, `SchemaMismatchError`,
  `ContentHashMismatchError`, and `BindingConflictError`.
- Vocabulary sheet defining the object storage contract, published at
  <https://danielle-rothermel.github.io/dr-store/>.
